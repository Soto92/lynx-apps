# Lynx pocs

## Overview

- What is [Lynx](https://lynxjs.org/)?

## Create a new Lynx project

1 - It's used Rspeedy (a Rspack-based Lynx build tool) to build Lynx projects.

It is recommended to start a new project using create-rspeedy, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```
yarn create rspeedy
```

2 - Install the NPM dependencies with package manager:

```
yarn install
```

3 - To start the development server, run:

```
yarn run dev
```

## Device

You need to install in your device the [LynxExplorer](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx/tree/develop/explorer/android) to scan the QR code of the terminal after the yarn run dev,
similar with Expo client.
